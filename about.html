    <p class = 'message'>
      Growing up as a Chinese adoptee in America, forming and expressing my identity,
       whether it be concerning my appearance, the language that I speak, how I present
        myself, and my feelings regarding topics like culture, heritage, and family, has
         always been a struggle. Questions such as, “What do I do when no one in my family
         looks like me?” and “Do I call myself Chinese or American? Neither? Both?” and
         “How do I define the word ‘family’ in a way that actually reflects my own feelings
          and experiences?” and “What is so important about staying connected with my culture?
          What is ‘my culture’, anyway?” constantly present themselves in all aspects of my daily
          life. From the moment I was old enough to understand what adoption is, I’ve embarked on
          the journey towards reconciling with these struggles and finding the answers to these questions. </p>

      <p class = 'message'> In fact, this is a journey that nearly every Chinese
         adoptee is bound to come across; it is a journey that is ongoing, without a
         clear end. I specify the term “Chinese” adoptee, for our struggles with racial,
          cultural, and linguistic identities are heightened by the fact that we are
          products of transnational adoption, living in transnational families, as
           well as products of China’s One Child Policy of the 80’s and 90’s. The
           experience of the transnational adoptee, or the Chinese adoptee, is
           distinct and unique from other cases of adoption. Moreover, as transnational adoptees,
           our opportunities to interact with other Chinese adoptees and other Chinese people,
           as well as the resources we have to learn about our culture and history, is very
            limited, if not non-existent. Hence, this project focuses on telling the story
            of the Chinese adoptee community, creating a safe space for members of our
            community to learn about and connect with each other’s experiences, and to
            foster their journey towards becoming their authentic selves. This project also
            acts as a site for individuals outside the community to learn about the nuances
             and complexities within the community, and for users to step outside their own
             positionality, immersing themselves in the perspective of the adoptee.</p>

        <p class = 'message'>
          Finally, I call this project is a digital ethnography,for I feel it is the most authentic way
          to present the complexities of the adoptee experience. which is a type of anthropology that
          deals with society and how its peoples/cultures operate within, taking the subjects
           personal experiences, feelings, and memories, interviews, and participant observation
           as the main method of research. Further, it is a form of digital ethnography because
            I will be using an interactive website, forums, and p5.js sketches to visualize my
            research and emulate the “adoptee experience”. </p>
