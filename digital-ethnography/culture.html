      <p> As an adoptee, claiming labels and definitions when it comes to talking about
        cultural identity is especially difficult...
      </p>
      <!-- <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
      <div class="entries" style = 'position: absolute;'> This is my DIV element. </div> -->
      <p> others make assumptions from what they think they know about adoption
         and expect the adoptee to reflect their idea of culture simply based on the way they look,
         how you dress, and how you act, all of which are things out of their control...</p>
      <p> Being asked “what are you” is never a fun experience. “What” is a relative
         pronoun that refers to an inanimate object, not a person. Yes, we are adoptees,
         but we are people too. The responses the adoptee have for questions like this
         vary depending on their own comfort level, how the question is delivered, etc... </p>
      <p> the adoptee's own process of figuring out how they want to identify and how they deal with
        others interfering with this process takes time; it doesn’t happen over night.
         it can take years to to understand such nuanced experiences. still,
         this process is ongoing.</p>
      <p>nevertheless, the emotional and psychological effect of navigating culture
        as an adoptee can feel incredibly alienating at times, no matter how many
        positive or negative experiences one may have. the adoptee identity is not
        only uncommon, but so complex and diverse to even other adoptees. Given this,
        finding a true sense of belonging sometimes feels impossible. Feeling alone,
        out of place, an “Other,” feeling like you are stuck between two worlds,
        being pushed away and pulled by either sides, are all common emotions the
        adoptee might experience. For many, they are emotions that are simply apart
        of the adoptee package, inevitable, unavoidable, and inescapable...</p>

      <div class = 'expandedtext'> "My understanding of culture is shaped by being Asian American,
               queer, and a Chinese adoptee that grew up in the white suburbs. I feel very
               partial in these communities. My experience is unlike most others. I didn’t
               grow up in a Chinese household, but I am also not a white person.
               As I have left my hometown, I have done a lot for myself to experience
               Chineseness apart from my white hometown and family. It is very rare to
                find other people that share these intersectional identities. Finding
                people that share even a part of these experiences is incredibly meaningful." </br> </div>

                have shared experiences within the culture. In my experience, I think being an

            I grew up in New England, so maybe I would say that I identify with more of a New England
            culture. It was what I lived and breathed and was surrounded by. I learned it both in school
            and from the people around me. It felt normal to me, and everything else felt ‘other.’"<br> </div>

              culture just like NYU Shanghai or my soccer team does. I’m not sure if I can

        is really dangerous, because it furthers the idea of purifying culture and the people
        of that culture. Chinese people come from so many different backgrounds and stories
        that it's hard to say that someone's "not Chinese enough" to partake in part of their
        own culture. It makes me feel sad that I'm being blamed for something that was not
        in my control and the matter is treated with such levity. When people call me "white-washed,"
         it translates to me as living up to some standard of whiteness and for which I should be
         ashamed. I wish if people were going to use this term, they could say it more specifically

              It also sucks because a lot of people casually throw it at someone as a joke,

            "I think people calling adoptees or other Asian Americans in general “white-washed”
