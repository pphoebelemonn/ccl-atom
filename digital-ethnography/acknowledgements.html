    <p class = 'message'>
      I want to thank Emily, Amy, Audrey, Catherine, Claire, Fiona, Elena, Maya D., KayLi,
      Taylor, Maya, Anya, and Millie for your help with this project. This truly
      wouldn't have been an 'digital ethnography' without you, and I appreciate all your eager
      participation and hard work. I recognize that communicating and conducting research
      online has its downfalls, however I want to express my gratitude to you all for making
      the research process so easy. I enjoyed every second of reading through
      all of your  beautiful, insightful responses to my countless questions. I laughed,
      I cried, and I learned so much, not only about your stories, but myself as well.</p>

      <p class = 'message'> In one way or another, each one of you has played an impactful and influencial
      part of my life, and as my journey as an adoptee. Even though we are in
      different parts of the world, it brings me great joy to have known all of you,
      and I'm comforted knowing that there will always be people in this world
      who share some of the same experiences as I have. This bond that we share, while
      difficult to understand sometimes, is precious. Sometimes I get selfish and want to
      keep it all to myself, but I've realized through currating this website that hearing your
      own experiences and reflecting on my own has helped me heal as a part of my adoptee identity
      that I didn't even know needed healing. Having the opportunity to transform all of this
      into my own blend of ethnography, web development, and interactive art is an enormous pleasure;
      it's a piece of my identity that I will keep close with me foreer. <br> <br>
