It’s more than just being dissatisfied with a few features here and there; it’s feeling “not right” or “out of place” in your own skin, because your outer identity is unchangeable, but your inner identity is constantly fluctuating as an adoptee. Your journey of identity is continuous and unbreakable, and this journey is reflected in your perception of your physical appearance." </p>

angsty, omg I hate everything, prepubescent, middle school years, I was always super aware of how I was perceived because I stood out

Chineseness or Asianness that can’t be stripped away even though I am
adopted." </p>

            Starting in senior year, I started to realize that I mainly had been surrounding
             myself with white kids and my mannerisms matched theirs. I thankfully never had
             anyone be directly racist towards me but when COVID-19 started, so did the Asian hate.
             It bothered me a lot even though it didn’t directly affect me. This is when I started
             to really realize how “white-washed” I really was." </p>

thinking that NOBODY looked like me. There were plenty of East Asian Chinese
people, but they were either paler, taller, thinner, girly, or boyish. I was none of those.
Of course, this not fitting in was also deeply connected to my queerness and presenting
androgynously, but I have a feeling that not seeing anyone that looked like me in my
school, community, or media impacted me greatly. I think recently I’ve begun to process
this. I still don’t really see that many people that look like me." </p>

This in turn has caused me to be very aware of my surroundings in terms of diversity and lack of it. The lack of media especially has pushed me to start writing and make adoptee content. " </p>

inequities, along with systems of oppression, I have been faced with a certain
level of cognitive dissonance. When I see or talk about traumatic events that
are happening to the Asian-American community, I feel a level of fear, anger,
and sadness but because of my identity, I often feel like I have not suffered
enough to be allowed to feel these emotions, so I’m left feeling helpless to my
own emotions. While I look like those who were and are being targeted, I have
features in my personality, the way I speak, and privilege of a white person
that I’m only beginning to unpack." </p>
