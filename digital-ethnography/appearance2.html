It’s more than just being dissatisfied with a few features here and there; it’s feeling “not right” or “out of place” in your own skin, because your outer identity is unchangeable, but your inner identity is constantly fluctuating as an adoptee. Your journey of identity is continuous and unbreakable, and this journey is reflected in your perception of your physical appearance." </p>

            Starting in senior year, I started to realize that I mainly had been surrounding
             myself with white kids and my mannerisms matched theirs. I thankfully never had
             anyone be directly racist towards me but when COVID-19 started, so did the Asian hate.
             It bothered me a lot even though it didn’t directly affect me. This is when I started

thinking that NOBODY looked like me. There were plenty of East Asian Chinese
people, but they were either paler, taller, thinner, girly, or boyish. I was none of those.
Of course, this not fitting in was also deeply connected to my queerness and presenting
androgynously, but I have a feeling that not seeing anyone that looked like me in my
school, community, or media impacted me greatly. I think recently I’ve begun to process
this. I still don’t really see that many people that look like me." </p>

inequities, along with systems of oppression, I have been faced with a certain

are happening to the Asian-American community, I feel a level of fear, anger,
and sadness but because of my identity, I often feel like I have not suffered
enough to be allowed to feel these emotions, so I’m left feeling helpless to my
own emotions. While I look like those who were and are being targeted, I have
features in my personality, the way I speak, and privilege of a white person

               me, there’s ABC me, there’s FOB me, there’s adoptee me. Even though these different versions
               are all me, they don't represent me wholly, because they cannot co-exist happily, and people can’t handle
