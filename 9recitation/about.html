    <p> SONG ARTIST: 马美如 <br>
      ENGLISH NAME: Tear Drops in the Wine Glass 
      LYRICIST: 曹军民 <br>
      PRODUCER: 李先锋 <br>
      RELEASE DATE: 2020 <br> </p>
    <p style = "font-size: 25" >Although this song was released just over a year ago, the song has its origins many years before.
      The lyrics are based on a folksong from the Shanbei minority group of northern China. Hence,
      the song is usually sung with an itense northern accent, which compliments the sharp and clear tone of
      the main instrument used in the song, Suona (唢呐). The Suona is a long, skinny, double-reed horn, whose
      shape resembles that of the Western bugle. In the song, the Suona can be heard in the song's
      introduction and the adlibs between the verses. <br>
      <br>
      The song has been covered many times, by both men and women. Singer Ma Meiru's (马美如) rendition
      of the song first reached Spotify in 2020, and it has been popular on Chinese social media apps
      Kuaishou and Douyin ever since. <br>
      <br>
      The meaning of the song is rather simple: a woman sings of her lost lover while drinking the night away, ]
      mourning over her heartbreak and hardships life brings her. However, the tone, passion, and angst that
      Ma Meiru pours into this performance brings this song to life, and makes her interpretation of the old
      folksong one of the best.
